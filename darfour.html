            The War in Darfur, also nicknamed the Land Cruiser War,[a] is a major armed conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan that began in February 2003 when the
             Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel groups began fighting the government of Sudan, which they accused of
              oppressing Darfur's non-Arab population.[21][22] The government responded to attacks by carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Darfur's 
              non-Arabs. This resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the indictment of Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, for genocide, 
              war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.[23]

            One side of the conflict is mainly composed of the Sudanese military, police and the Janjaweed, a Sudanese militia group whose members are mostly 
            recruited among Arabized indigenous Africans and a small number of Bedouin of the northern Rizeigat; the majority of other Arab groups in Darfur 
            remained uninvolved.[24] The other side is made up of rebel groups, notably the SLM/A and the JEM, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim Fur,
             Zaghawa, and Masalit ethnic groups. The African Union and the United Nations also have a joint peacekeeping mission in the region, named UNAMID. 
             Although the Sudanese government publicly denies that it supported the Janjaweed, evidence supports claims that it provided financial assistance
              and weapons and coordinated joint attacks, many against civilians.[25][26] Estimates of the number of human casualties range up to several hundred 
              thousand dead, from either combat or starvation and disease. Mass displacements and coercive migrations forced millions into refugee camps or
               across the border, creating a humanitarian crisis. Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell described the situation as a genocide or acts of genocide.
               
            
            The Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue peace.
             The JEM has the most to gain from the talks and could see semi-autonomy much like South Sudan.[28] However, talks were disrupted by accusations that
              the Sudanese army launched raids and air strikes against a village, violating the Tolu agreement. The JEM, the largest rebel group in Darfur, 
              vowed to boycott negotiations.[29]
